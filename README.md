# Toggl Plan Take Home Project

## Implemented features

- Timeline View is shown with grid & dates
- Fetch & display tasks from API. The date range of API is based on size of viewport.
- Next & Previous navigation buttons which fetches previous / next month's tasks & displays them on timeline view.
- Swimlane whose height is updated based on the lowest & highest horizontally stacked task.
- Tasks are stacked horizontally based on weight of task w.r.t other tasks in the same date range. Higher the weight, lower the task position.
- Drag & drop functionality which positions the task correctly in the updated time range (vertical position will not be updated by task weight but tasks will not overlap).
- Handle common API errors like API details not set or Authentication failed.

## The Mission

Hello there future Toggl Plan Frontend Engineer! We're excited to see what you can do. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to replicate a simplified version of the team timeline view in [Toggl Plan](https://plan.toggl.com/). To do this you'll need to create a new Toggl Plan account on our staging server: https://plan.toggl.space and use the API to fetch the data you need.

Some notes:

- The template is already set up with a basic Svelte+Tailwind+Vite setup. Feel free to add any other libraries you want.
- The data should be fetched from our staging API. You can use `https://api.plan.toggl.space/api/v6-rc1/{workspace_id}/tasks?since={yyyy-mm-dd}&until={yyyy-mm-dd}&short=true&team={team_id}` endpoint.
- There is no need to consider task assignees. Place all tasks in one swimlane.
- No need to implement authentication, just keep the auth token, workspace ID, and team ID in local storage.
- Since / Until dates can be +- 1 week from current date.
- Focus on placing tasks on the timeline (in a Tetris-like manner, "weight" property is used to place tasks vertically), and set up a basic drag and drop functionality (move task horizontally). Vertical drag and drop is not required.
- Changes to data should not be persisted to the API. Just keep them in memory.
- No need to replicate the exact UI

## Getting Started

The first step is to fork this repo so that a fork exists on your own GitHub account. After you have forked the repo, clone your forked version down onto your machine.

Install the repo's dependencies:

`pnpm install`

Then start the local server:

`pnpm run dev`

Open the browser with the URL printed on the terminal, & run this JS snippet on the dev console:

```js

localStorage.setItem('token', "<Auth-Token>"),
localStorage.setItem('teamId', "<Team-id>"),
localStorage.setItem('workspaceId', "<Workspace-id>"),
```

Please remember to commit often so we can see how you're doing ðŸ™Œ

## Deploy

No need to deploy the project anywhere. Just send us a link to your forked repo.
